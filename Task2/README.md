This is a readme file to the second task.

To provide folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path use the command line arguments.

- first argument is the main file name;
- second argument is the synchronization interval;
- third argument is the log file path.

For example, to run the program, paste into the command line:

cd <path_to_task2_folder>
python copying_files.py 120 logs.txt

where:
- copying_files.py - main file
- 120 - the synchronization interval (in minutes)
- logs.txt - log file
