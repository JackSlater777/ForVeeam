This is a readme file to the second task.

To provide folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path use the command line arguments.

- first argument is the main file name;
- second argument is the synchronization interval;
- third argument is the log file path.

For example, to run the program, paste into the command line:

cd <path_to_task2_folder>

python run.py 60 logs.txt

where:
- run.py - main file
- 60 - the synchronization interval (in seconds)
- logs.txt - log file
